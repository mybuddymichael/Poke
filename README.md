# Poke

Poke is a simple game-design project using [Ruby] and [Gosu]. It is intended to be a two-dimensional adventure game, similar to that wonderful Japanese game about [pockets and monsters] (hence, "Poke", which is certainly a working title).

## So what will the game be like?

I'm thinking robots. In your pocket. (Pokébots?)

## The future

The future of Poke is certainly uncertain, as it's a side-project on which I spend only a limited amount of my free time. That said, I hope to implement the following features:

- An open-ended randomly-generated world, à la Minecraft, Infiniminer, Dwarf Fortress, and the previous pioneers of an open and random game world.
- A system to give the player a sense of accomplishment and a goal. (Possibly collecting or creating robots.)
- A crafting system that allows the player to create various items, vehicles, and robots of infinite possibilities.

See, like I said, simple.

## Currently

Poke is in an alpha of alpha state right now. The engine is being actively built and much is frequently changing. It's not a game. It's not fun in any way. However, if after that you would like to try it out, here's how...

## Installation

Poke runs on Ruby 1.9.x. To easily install this, I highly recommend you install [RVM]. You can read how on the RVM website. I also recommend you install the [Bundler] gem, which makes installation and updating of gems crazy-easy. So, without further adieu:
